## Hello! 
I'm a Games Design and Programming graduate, with a focus on the programming. I know C# and C++, mostly in a games context, in engines such as Unity and Unreal, but I'm working on learning more general computer science programming to become a software developer. I'm currently working as a Junior Software Tester as part of a payments team which includes manually testing of payment flows and creating automated tests in Gherkin and SQL for testing of REST APIs.
